# Midterm - Vision Board Builder

In my project, I wanted to combine the concepts we learned in the in-class excercises, such as Image search, nav bars using React Router DOM, useState, and Tailwind CSS styling. I decided to create a vision board builder web app with basic functionalities similar to that of Pinterest. The main challenge is to remember the images that the users saved and to display them on a different page, which I was able to achieve by using arrays and passing down props to the components.
